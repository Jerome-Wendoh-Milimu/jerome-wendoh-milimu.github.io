# My interests
My passion is to facilitate the application of data-driven/evidence-based & people-centred decision making in the Health sector for the improvement of lives & livelihoods in Africa. I am also very excited about building capacity on the continent by developing scientific skills and confidence in the youth to be able to rise to the occasion and come up with homegrown technological solutions to the challenges affecting the continent.
